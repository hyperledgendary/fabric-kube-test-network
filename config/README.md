# Config Folder 

This configuration files in this folder, if present, were created by the `install-fabric.sh` script when 
downloading the peer CLI binaries to the root folder of the project.  These files are not used and can 
be ignored.

To review the channel and peer configurations used by this sample, see [channel-config](../channel-config/config).
